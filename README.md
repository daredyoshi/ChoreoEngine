# choreoEngine

This is heavily based on the amazing [Game Engnie](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT) series by [The Cherno](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ-W1KE9EYfdxhL6S4twUNw)

External Dependencies needed in include path

(I used the AUR ones)

[spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog)
[glfw](https://www.glfw.org/)


General Note

I use pre-compiled headers but still #include for sementics and code completion
